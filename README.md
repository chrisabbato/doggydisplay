# Doggy Display

Everyone loves cute dog pictures, get your fill here!

## Data Source

[Dog API](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/)

## Things I'd like to add

- Support for suspense/placeholder when loading the images
- A fetch wrapper (perhaps axios instead)
- A CSS-in-JS solution or TailwindCSS or Component UI Library
- State machine to handle the loading/error/display state of components using [XState](https://xstate.js.org/)
